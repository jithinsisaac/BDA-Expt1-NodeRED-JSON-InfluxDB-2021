### Laboratory Experiment No. 2
 
### Objective  
To encode & decode JSON messages (Semi-structed data) & To learn and implement the InfluxDB Time Series Database used to measure IoT sensor data, via Node-RED in an AWS EC2 instance.

### Tools used  
- Software: 
  - Node-RED https://nodered.org/
  - InfluxDB https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/
- Cloud: AWS EC2

### Experiment Outcome
- To install Node-RED in an AWS EC2 instance and to auto boot it at start
- To learn about JSON messages (Semi structured data)
- To encode data in the form of JSON & decode it using Node-RED
- To install InfluxDB database in the EC2 instance
- To inject data into the InfluxDB database using Node-RED
- To plot charts & time series graph of the injected data using Node-RED dashboard

### Instructions
